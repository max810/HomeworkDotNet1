## Self-playing interactive (jk) novel "AI not incuded"
This is the first hometask on C# in EPAM External .Net course (fall 2018).
Made solely by me, Maksym Bekuzarov.

## Usage
Just compile the solution and launch it - the output is different every time.
At least it should be, tweaking those random probabilities is not that easy.
